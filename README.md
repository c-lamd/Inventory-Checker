# Storytime:
My girlfriend really wanted a bag, but it was sold out:( I heard rumors online that it might come in stock. After scraping info from the site, I found that the bag came in stock for 6 seconds at a time around 2-3AM. SO- I set up some scripts on AWS so it could run on a virtual machine, and I copped the bag and surprised my girlfriend:) She was very happy and I felt very accomplished, as it was the first time I made a project that was able to have an actual impact on my life.
